The `simulation.xslt` template in this folder can replace the one within FLAME. It adds additional code to the cleanup method that will 3D dimensional agent location messages to the file `flameagents.txt`. The format is simply the number of agents on the first line, followed by a comma delimited vec3 on each subsequent line.

As such this template won't compile correctly with models containing differently named agents, and the additional IO overhead is worth avoiding outside of validation scenarios.
